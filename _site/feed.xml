        <title>Jack Wolfskin Gossamer 1 Review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Internal dimensions: Length 230cm, Height 70cm, Width 95cm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction: PU coated 75D Polyester, Alloy poles and pegs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weight: 1550g&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pack size: 45cmx17cm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Pros&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Great build quality&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Separate fly sheet&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Striking design&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Relatively cheap&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Cons&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Tough to pitch correctly&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Damp problems&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Limited storage&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/media/img/gossamer/cover.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Gossamer in all it&#39;s saggy glory.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought my Gossamer from OutdoorGear.co.uk for £75 last April, before the BoldlyGoes trip to Spain.  I initially chose it over the Wild Country Zephyros 1, due to it’s interesting design, completely separate flysheet and £35 price difference. The two-pole tunnel design isn’t a popular tent design, but it looks great and pitching is a breeze, even in bad conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build-quality&quot;&gt;Build Quality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The build quality of the Gossamer is remarkably good, 10 months after purchase, and dozens of pitches later, all of the seams are still tight, the DAC poles are as good as new, and although I lost one peg, the others are all still straight despite quite a lot of abuse.  The one component which requires improvement is the ground sheet, which professes to have a 5,000mm hydrostatic head, but will let beads of moisture through by the morning.  The tent includes only 10 pegs while the design actually requires 12 including guy lines, but unless it’s very windy, these are optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/media/img/gossamer/pack.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;High quality materials and a small pack size make it attractive for backpackers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of the Gossamer straddles the line between the low, compact, hooped bivvys and the roomier 1 man backpacking tents with room to sit up and porches to store your backpack.  This fusion results in a compromised experience, just entering the tent requires some thought, the door is at the head end rather than at the side, this requires you to stand up in the entrance, then filter yourself into the tent and your sleeping bag at the same time, feet first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gossamer has a large unsupported mid section, which ends up sagging however tight I pitch, this sag, seen in most hooped bivvys is not an issue with single walled gore-tex designs. But, coupled with the double walled design of the gossamer, this sag results in condensation soaking your clothes or sleeping bag after even the smallest movements during the night or morning.  This sag could be solved easily with two extra guy lines halfway up either side of the tent, but the curved design limits the options there without pulling the top of the tent flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of a porch or any storage space is also an issue.  There isn’t room for anything larger than a 35 litre backpack inside next to you, and only boots can be stored in between the two walls.  If you’re camping in colder weather or have a lot of gear with you, the only option is to stick the whole lot in a dry bag and leave it outside, not entirely secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are inside and as long as you don’t move too much, the Gossamer is very cosy inside, and the lack of space actually means it warms up very quickly.  There is a useful guy line running along the ceiling of the tent where you can hang lights, it also tensions the ceiling to stop a bit of that lethal sag.  The low design lends itself to stability in high winds and the position of the side pegs does afford some control over the airflow into the tent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alternatives&quot;&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’ve said, the Gossamer has slotted itself into a strange place in the market, where it finds itself competing with budget tents, more expensive entry level backpacking tents and most hooped bivvys.  My second choice when looking for a tent was the Wild Country Zephyros 1, this much roomier back packing tent features a porch, room to sit up and change and weighed slightly less, but it was £35 more expensive.  The Snugpak Stratosphere Hooped Bivi features a superior construction quality and materials, but had even less storage space and the same £35 price difference.  The Highlander Blackthorn 1 was the budget option at half the price of the Gossamer, has the same design as the now legendary Gelert Solo, but suffered from terrible build quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;bg-scroll&quot; style=&quot;background-image: url(&#39;/media/img/gossamer/reverse.jpg&#39;)&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the Gossamer 1 would be a great first tent for anyone given its modest price tag, but it is let down by the lack of conviction in it’s design, or possibly it’s total conviction to not be like any other tent on the market. When I want to sit in my tent and watch the rain, I am forced to just get up like when I am bivvy bagging.  When I feel cosy and warm like in a bivvy bag, I get damp from the condensation like I am in a cramped tent.  It’s the best and worst of both worlds, but no one fault completely hampers the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t regret the purchase and I can see it surviving at least two or three more seasons, it isn’t too heavy or bulky enough to put me off carrying it on longer hikes.  However, if it broke I would not buy it again, I’d spend a little extra for the added comfort and gear security offered by the Wild Country Zephyros 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/media/img/gossamer/door.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Gossamer never finds it&#39;s stride, but it&#39;s still a well made starter tent.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rating-24&quot;&gt;Rating: 2/4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entry level gear that we probably wouldn’t buy again if it broke.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Overnight Kit </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is currently what will be found in my bag if I was out for just a night or two in the woods. Everything I need (not just to survive a night outdoors but enjoy it in great comfort too) can fit into this 35 litre rucksack. And in many ways, out of all the different configurations of gear I have, whether it’s for a multi-day trip by bike or on foot, or just a day out on the hills; this overnight pack is perhaps my most refined: pared down to the essentials but without compromising on comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no tent; just a hammock, bivvy, and tarp - and to be honest, if the weather is looking good the tarp will stay at home. I will take this opportunity to endorse relegating your tent from your overnight setup and switching to a hammock. It is lighter, much more comfortable, and there is no better sight to wake up to than the sun breaking through a thick canopy of green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a walkthrough of all my gear with a brief description of what is and how it found its way into my bag (and perhaps what it pushed out too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/media/img/overnight_kit.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;My kit and packed bag.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lowe-alpine-airzone-35-litre-rucksack&quot;&gt;Lowe Alpine Airzone 35 litre Rucksack&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ENO Double Nest Hammock -  I bought this while I was in the States from a huge outdoor store called REI. It was a steal at just $30 or $40 (I can’t remember exactly now). Sadly, these seem hard to get in the UK without having to pay out a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;oex-34-length-self-inflating-sleeping-pad&quot;&gt;OEX 3/4 length self inflating sleeping pad&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is made by Go Outdoor’s exclusive brand OEX, as a cheaper alternative to a Thermarest I think it is very good indeed. You can read a full review here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;british-army-gore-tex-bivvy-bag&quot;&gt;British Army Gore-tex Bivvy bag&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love this bivvy, sure it takes up more space in my bag than other bags but it is extremely breathable, tough, and big enough to stow your rucksack in the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vango-planet-50-sleeping-bag&quot;&gt;Vango Planet 50 sleeping bag&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheap and cheerful. Packs really small and is more than good enough for a warm summers night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tarp&quot;&gt;Tarp&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;morakniv-knife&quot;&gt;Morakniv Knife&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t got one, get one. Amazing value for such a high quality knife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;zebra-14cm-billy-can&quot;&gt;Zebra 14cm Billy Can&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really nicely made billy can that quickly found a permanent spot in my bag despite being slightly cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;msr-pocket-rocket&quot;&gt;MSR pocket Rocket&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small, powerful, and won’t leave too much of a dent in the wallet. Only complaint, when rigged up on top of a gas can with a pot of boiling water perched on top it does topple very easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;camelbak-podium-water-bottles&quot;&gt;Camelbak Podium Water Bottles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought these for cycle touring and now they come everywhere with me. They have great locking valves that never leak in the bottom of your bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;moleskin-notepad-and-pencil&quot;&gt;Moleskin Notepad and Pencil&lt;/h4&gt;

        <title>24-hours in Norfolk</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s only 6 o’clock but it feels like the middle of the night. In truth, I really think even the middle of the night during summer would pale in comparison to the heavy veil of darkness laid upon us by that of the bleak days of November. It was perhaps against conventional wisdom to be camping that night but there we were anyway, sat on the Norfolk coast, not far from Wells-next-the-Sea, mesmerised by the lights of nearby fishing boats slowly panning our horizon and comforted by many layers of clothing and a box of fine Spanish wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;bg-scroll&quot; style=&quot;background-image: url(&#39;/media/img/norfolk.jpg&#39;)&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d arrived just in time to see the last of daylight and walked beneath vast formations of geese veeing over as they returned through pale blue skies to winter on our shores. Everyone else was walking home whilst we headed in the opposite direction, towards the dunes, adorned with large rucksacks and armed with thinly veiled excuses in case we where met with prying questions as to what it was we were up to. Of course, we only met smiles and hello’s and not so much as a glimpse of suspicion from anyone that we may be planning to camp (illegally) amongst the band of coniferous trees that defends the landed Holkham estate from the encroaching sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, as is always the case in England, we skulked into the woods, hoping to not be seen and reserving a place in the backs of our minds for fears of being caught and lumped with convictions for trespassing. Whenever we wild camp we are meticulous when it comes to clearing any scrap of evidence that would betray our presence and are mindful that we are not welcome to loiter, but rather we should always arrive late and leave early and stay no more than one night. And still we gladly do these things so that we can spend some time in nature, uninterrupted by the pressures of modern life and fully immersed in our surroundings. During a winter camp this translates to being constantly surprised by just how early it is and being forced to live at winters pace, throwing our circadian rhythms back into long-lost kilter, and also to having the chance to be the sole inhabitants of a stretch of one of England’s most beautiful beaches for a night. Because for that night it all belonged to us: the crashing waves, the distant flickering lights of the wind farms, the murmuring masses of geese roosting in the salt marshes, and the heavy black sky pierced by myriad silver stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;bg-scroll&quot; style=&quot;background-image: url(&#39;/media/img/norfolk1.jpg&#39;)&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We returned from the beach, carefully retracing our way back in to the woods to our camp and went about chewing the fat (literally, in the case of my curry) beside the small fire we’d lit and the before too long went to bed, probably earlier than we’ve been in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning we awoke to the pattering of rain on the canvasses above us, a quintessential sound of camping. Despite urges to stay hunkered down, cozy in our sleeping bags, we got up and quickly dismantled our shelters and went about forensically replacing logs, twigs, and leaf litter to mask any indication of our camp and headed back to civilisation and normality where we’ll stay until we find our next adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
