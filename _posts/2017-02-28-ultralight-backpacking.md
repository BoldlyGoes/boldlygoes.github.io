<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"> Why go ultralight? When go ultralight? How go ultralight? </p>

_In this series I’ll be taking you through my thought process as I shaved the pounds off of my setup, taking it from a bloated giant which will drag me down with it, to a sleek ultralight bundle that I hardly notice as I skip along the cliffside like a mountain goat who’s just discovered weight watchers.  Hopefully you’ll find some tips that you can use with your gear, if you have any tips of your own, remember to share them in the comments!_

Until now, the majority of my camping has involved setting up a base camp somewhere a few miles out from the car and day hiking to explore the surrounding area with only a day sack on my back.  Recently, however, I have planned a few more adventurous trips which will involve hiking and camping with everything on my back for two weeks or more, this is when lighter gear starts to seem very appealing.  

Being outside is great fun; hiking, cycling, canoeing, camping, these have all been enjoyed as past times since the 1800s when camping and hiking were first popularised.  Things can be made much less fun, however, if you are forced to carry enormous weight while you partake in them.  


>"Very few young men who read this book will find it possible to enjoy themselves, and carry more than twenty pounds a greater distance than ten miles a day, for a week." 
<br><b>John Mead Gould in 'How To Camp Out'</b>

That was written in 1877.  Twenty pounds was more than the advised limit when hiking recreationally for an american civil war veteran.  He was surely a lot tougher than you or I, probably a fair bit stronger, and even he didn’t carry a heavy pack back when everything was made from either wool or iron.  

These days a pack base weight of around 20lbs will class you as a ‘lightweight’ backpacker, but if it was too heavy in 1877, it’s certainly too heavy for my flimsy millennial bones today.  A pack weighing 5lbs will apparently see you classified as a ‘super-ultralight’ or ‘hyperlight’ backpacker.  From what I have seen, this weight is where you enter the realms of record breaking, astonishingly fast hikers who blaze past you with no time to concentrate on the scenery or get a trail name that doesn’t involve a superlative.  These hikernators usually forgo every creature comfort they can to save weight, and eat only food with the highest of calorie to weight ratios.  Because I’m not keen on re-hydrated beans, and wouldn’t mind the odd cup of coffee on the trail, I’m going to aim for the middle ground. 10lbs. Ultralight.

The first step in lightening your load is also the easiest and certainly the cheapest; you just need to unpack everything and start from the beginning.  Starting from the bottom forces you to tackle everything you put into your pack; you’re looking at each item in a new light now, a revealing, minimalist, white light which isn’t flattering to anything but the essential.  You need to really think about how important everything is before you put it in your bag, and it’s likely even your bag could lose some weight.

When I repacked the first time, I picked up only the things which are directly linked to my survival outdoors; water, shelter and food.

Image before and after: Two images dide by side, one empty rucksack surrounded by all my things, one empty rucksack surrounded by the essentials.

This is what my pack contains so far:

Water containers and water purification tablets - weight
<br>
Tent and sleeping system (Sleeping bag and foam mat)
<br>
My alcohol stove and pan set with spoon

Notice that I've chosen simple re-usable plastic bottles for my water, a foam roll as a sleeping mat and will be eating from the one pot which I cook in.  This saves me the weight of a water bladder and hose, the heavy plastic of an inflatable sleeping mat, and a bowl or mug which I had been bringing to eat out of.  I've also chosen a simple plastic spoon which weighs 10 grams, over a more expensive, fancy titanium contraption from Amazon, because, it's a spoon.  

Note that you could also opt for a stoveless setup, but we'll [get to that later](https://boldlygoes.co.uk/blog/features/ultralight-part-5 "Part 5") 

Now we have a base, base weight.  These items are the ones which probably aren't going to change depending on the season or the amount of time we hike for. In the next part, we'll look at the items which are going to vary depending on the season and weather during your time outdoors.
