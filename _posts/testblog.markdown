Initially, I was trepidacious about purchasing a camping Hammock, I had seen many good reviews, as well as videos showing their use in the wild, but all of these sources were american, usually on trails in the mountains where trees were in no short supply.  I envisioned myself turning up to a campsite after a hard days walk or cycle and finding a meadow, maybe with one tree, but certainly nowhere to hang a hammock.  This apprehension lasted until I found an image online of a traveller who, for lack of trees, had fashioned a tent out of their hammock using their bicycle and a tent peg.  This image kindled the beleif that I had found a form of shelter which was infititely adaptable while also being lighter than all but the most expensive ultra-light tents.

After some deliberation, the Hennessey Hammock seemed like the best choice for me. It came with a built-in tarp, or rain-fly, to keep the rain off, which is essential for camping in England.  It also boasted free "snake skins", which purported to allow easy set up and packing in mere minutes, which is also an enormous bonus in my largely wet-weather country.

I waited for a sale and made my order, an "Ultralight explorer, asymmetrical"
