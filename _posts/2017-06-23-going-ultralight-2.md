Having taken preliminary action in the [first article]({{ site.github.url }}/features/going-ultralight-1) we have established a decent starting point for an ultralight base weight.  Depending on the quality and cost of your existing gear you should have a current base weight somewhere close to mine, perhaps even lighter.

My base weight so far is **4343g (9lb 9.19oz)** but we can reduce this even further pretty easily using just a pair of scissors and some household scraps, while retaining all of the previous functionality.  The changes I make might seem small, but they will add up quickly.

First up, water.  Some easy reductions to be made here simply by switching to retail plastic water bottles.  The hiker’s favorite brand seems to be Smart Water at the moment due to the fact that the thread of the bottle top matches perfectly with Sawyer filtration products, and the slim design makes it easier to fit them into free space inside your pack or pockets on the outside.

I couldn’t find any 1L bottles so I bought 3 600ml bottles for 60p each; sans the plastic ring and label they come in at 30g each, I'll upgrade to two 2L bottles when I can find them.  I added a 7g scoop because it makes filling the bottles in a stream much easier, really reducing the chance of cross-contamination.  These bottles are cheaper than my existing water containers and save me a total of **98g**. 

The next easy saving can be made with my cooking system.  While my Trangia 28-T is fantastic, the burner is makes up two thirds of the overall weight, and I hardly ever use the frying pan.  I did a quick bit of research into homemade soda can stoves and after some deliberation settled on the [Yak Small] stove design from Logan Watts at Bikepacking.com, this stove features roughly the same burn time and a faster time to boil as the Trangia but weighs 90% less. I got straight into it with my scissors and after a few cuts and scrapes ended up with a 10g stove which not only replaces the 115g Trangia stove, but also functions as it’s own pot stand. Weight saved: **258g**.

The final easy save can be had from my bag itself; reaching for the scissors again, I removed some totally useless floppy elastic webbing and chopped the ends off of all my adjustment straps, making them closer to what I normally set them to.  I also removed the aluminium frame which only improves the fit of the pack when it is heavy, making the contents of my pack lighter has allowed me to save weight on the pack itself.cade alteration is made possible by having a lighter pack; the lighter the pack, the less comfort measures required.  If my pack weight continues to drop, removing more adjustment straps and even the waist strap will become an option. This pack reduction saved me a total of **245g**.

So, I’ve spent a grand total of £2.40 and shaved **601g / 1lb 5.2oz** off, giving me a new, refined base weight of [**3742g / 8lb 3.99oz**](https://lighterpack.com/r/20qlna).
