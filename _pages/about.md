Boldy Goes was founded by three lads from Hertfordshire; James, Harvey, and Sam, whose shared love for the outdoors brought them together and inspired them to create this website. Since its beginnings, Boldly Goes has grown outwards, welcoming guest contributors such as Trefor Edwards and his amazing adventures wild camping in every London borough, which you can read about [here]({{ site.github.url }}/features/borough-bivvy-bagging).
